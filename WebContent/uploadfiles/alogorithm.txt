? K-MEANS K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. K-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. ? NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING  (NLP) Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. ? SENTIMENT ANALYSIS Extract subjective information usually from a set of documents, often using online reviews to determine "polarity" about specific objects. It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in the social media, for the purpose of marketing.

? Tokenization  Transforming a stream of characters into a stream of processing units called tokens. ? Stop Words Filtering  Consists in eliminating stop-words. ? Stemming The process of reducing each word (i.e., token) to its stem or root form, by removing its suffix. ? Stem Filtering Consists in reducing the number of stems of each SUM. ? Featuring Representation  
? WEB SERVICE  Web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a network. It is a software function provided at a network address over the Web with the service always on as in the concept of utility computing. The W3C defines a Web service generally as, a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. ? GRAPHS  R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. R language is used to generate the analysis graphs, like histogram, bar graph, pie chart.
